# glue-benchmark
take on how close we can get to a flexible glue-benchmark where it matters.

## Why
Apart from measuring the progress of research in NLP and NLP transfer learning, the Glue collection offers a good and varied set of low level NLP capabilities which can be used in a variety of higher level solutions. For instance, in large text & news corpora discerning entailment is key to reducing the volume of inputs as well as identifying truly new information.
